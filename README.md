It includes:

Data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy

Statistical analysis using t-tests and confidence intervals

Metrics calculation: conversion rates, p-values

Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Goal: Provide data-driven decisions on whether to implement a new feature or change.
